As Chairperson, Caroline is involved in organizing and overseeing the BGSA and its events, as well as acting as a representative and reaching out externally for events, collaborations and projects.

In her free time, you can find Caroline bouncing between her arts and crafts, bothering her friends, or hiding out in nature.

Tamara (she/her) is a first-year PhD student in the Social Ecology and Conservation Collaborative. Her research is a part of the Importance and Values of ‘Provisioning Fisheries’ in the Great Lakes project, exploring the human dimensions of fisheries at the intersections of socio-ecological systems, socio-cultural values, food security, and wellbeing. As Co-Chair Animal Care Committee (ACC), she attends monthly ACC meetings and reviews ACC reports and requests from Carleton staff and students. She loves being a member of the BGSA because she believes student voices are essential for decision-making and good governance practices across the university. When she is not conducting research or attending meetings you can find her on a hike, reading (snuggled up with her cats), and enjoying coffee at local cafes with friends.
